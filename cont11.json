    "how_we_work": [
      "Users interact with Hyper 0x by performing everyday actions—spending, working, computing, or staking.",
      "Each action is captured by our protocol layers (RAWs, payroll engine, confidential compute, staking modules).",
      "These layers automatically track, process, and distribute rewards to users based on predefined smart contract rules.",
      "We use on-chain logic to trigger token flows and revenue splits in real-time, reducing friction and central dependency.",
      "All data processing happens within decentralized confidential compute environments, preserving privacy and ensuring trust."

    "how_users_earn": [
      "Spend with integrated services → Get rewarded with cashback in native token or partner tokens.",
      "Receive salary through blockchain payroll → Automatically stake and earn additional yield.",
      "Contribute idle compute (laptops, servers) → Run encrypted workloads and earn per cycle.",
      "Stake native tokens → Receive real, usage-based APY (not inflated token rewards).",
      "Refer new users or integrate our modules → Earn transaction revenue share through RAWs."
